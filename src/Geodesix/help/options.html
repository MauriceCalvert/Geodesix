            <p>The Options dialog is used to set advanced options.</p>

            <h1>API Key Tab</h1>
            <img src="optionskey.jpg" />
            <p>
                Used to supply the Google Maps API key, which is free.
                Geodesix requires this to get geographical information from Google.

            <h1>Geocoder Tab</h1>
            <img src="optionsgeocoder.jpg" />
            <p>
                Used to debug Region and Language problems with the Geocoder.
            </p>

            <h1>Advanced Tab</h1>
            <img src="optionsadvanced.jpg" />
            <p>
                Used to debug problems with the proxy setup.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cache statistics. When Geodesix retrieves information from Google, the
                data is cached and slyly saved inside the workbook. Purge Cache empties this cache
                (and all data will be re-requested).
            </p>
            <p>Reset All Options. Revert all options to the installation defaults.
            This does not change drawing settings, which are specific to each workbook.</p>
            <p>
                Debug mode. Play with this at your own risk.
                Switches on debug logging, which enables debugging tools on the ribbon and 
                writes reams of trace information to <monospace>My Documents\Geodesix\GeodesiX.log</monospace>.
                Takes effect when Excel is restarted and a warning will be displayed until debugging is switched off.
                This is <em>expensive</em> and Excel will become sluggish.
