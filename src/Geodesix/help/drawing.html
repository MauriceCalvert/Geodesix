            <h1>Fields</h1>
            <p>
                Each place to be drawn on the map is represented by a row in the worksheet.
                A place is recognised by having a latitude and a longitude <em>field</em> in the header row:
            <p>
                <img src="fields.jpg" />
            <p>
                Alongside the latitude and a longitude fields are optional further fields which:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fetch information from Google Maps: latitude, longitude, locality political, postal_code, ...</li>
                <li>Specify how the place will be drawn: icon, title, ...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Every field has a default value, which can be overridden for each place by specifying the value in
                the column with the field's name.
                These field names can be inserted with the
                <a href="fieldpicker.jpg">Insert&#8658;Field dialog</a> dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
                N.B. The latitude and a longitude column field labels must be within the
                the first 10 rows and the first 25 columns.
            </p>
            <h1>Setting the default values for drawing on the map</h1>
            <p>The Toools&#8658;Drawing dialog is used to set the default drawing values:</p>
