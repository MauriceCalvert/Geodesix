            <h1>Reducing the number of places to display</h1>
            <p>
                GPS tracks frequently have a large number of places.
                When displayed as-is this can produce a cluttered map.
                Several techniques can be applied to deal with this.
            </p>
            <h2>Filtering at import</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="templateeditor.html">Templates</a> can have Skip conditions to
                select only relevant data. For example, skipping visits when moving less than
                100 metres or visits less than 15 minutes:

            <p>
                Notice the syntax for date and timespan constants.
                Also, the use of 'previous' variables <b>_</b>Latitude and <b>_</b>Longitude
                in the Distance formula.
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, Skip on speed < 150Km/h:</p>

            <p>extracts only flights:</p>

            <h2>Filtering with Excel</h2>
            <p>
                Geodesix only imports rows that are visible; hiding unwanted rows
                prevents them from being drawn on on the map. Adding columns for speed,
                duration, etc. allow filtering on the same base data.
            </p>
            <h2>Reduce icon size</h2>
            <p>
                When mapping output from fitness apps, it is the paths that are of
                interest and not the icons themselves. This can be acheived with Tools&#8658;Drawing
                and setting the iconSize to a small value.
            </p>
            <h1>Sorting places with references to preceding rows</h1>
            <p>
                When referring to the preceding row, to calculate a distance or time,
                removing rows or sorting the data will make invalid references:
            </p>
            <img src="techniquessort1.jpg" />
            <p>This can be fixed by using Excel's Offset function:</p>
