            <p>Insert Field prompts to add one or more fields to the header row:</p>

                The fields on the left are the first argument of the GeoCode function;
                they return information about a place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fields on the right are drawing overrides;
                they allow individual rows to be drawn differently to those set in Tools&#8658;Drawing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Double-clicking a field inserts it at the current cell and moves the focus
                to the next cell on the right, to add subsequent fields. In this example, double-clicking longitude will insert "longitude" in D1
                and make E1 the active cell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that only one request is made to Google Maps
                to get the information about the Sphinx, Google Maps returns a set of fields
                which vary according to the type of place being queried.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, the fields on the left are populated dynamically from Google Map's responses
                and will change depending on the details available for the places that have been geocoded.
                The unusual airport field appears in this example
                because there was a formula<br /><code>=GeoCode("status",&nbsp;"JF&nbsp;Kennedy&nbsp;Airport")</code><br />
                that returned "John&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Kennedy&nbsp;International&nbsp;Airport"
                in the "airport&nbsp;establishment&nbsp;point_of_interest" field.
