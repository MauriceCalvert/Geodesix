                        When you search in Google Maps, you may receive several results.
                        For example searching for 'Maloja 7516, Stampa, Switzerland' might return
                        'Maloja 7516, Stampa, Switzerland' and '7516, Switzerland'.
                        Geodesix filters out these ambiguities automatically.

                    <td>
                        When Geodesix requests information from Google Maps, the results are cached,
                        because a round-trip to Google is very time-consuming and Excel will re-request the
                        data every time formulas are re-calculated.
                        This cache, one for Geocode requests and one for Travel requests,
                        are stored in very-hidden worksheets in the workbook. Thus, when the workbook is shared
                        no further requests are made to Google Maps.

                        This indicates that the maximum number of requests allowed by Google Maps per 24 hours have been exceeded.
                        Nothing can be done; wait 24 hours.

                    <td>
                        To display a map, the worksheet must have at least a Latitude and a Longitude column,
                        both of which must be within the the first 10 rows and the first 25 columns.

                    <td>
                        Chopes Beer is a ficticious beer company.
                        "Chope", pronounced 'shop', is Swiss French slang for a half-litre tankard of beer.
                        The name is derived from the Alsacien <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chope"><em>schoppe</em></a> "a big beer glass".

                        The file to import was processed but no rows satisfied the conditions.
                        Either the template doesn't correspond to the file (and no fields matched the template), or the Skip conditions are to broad.
