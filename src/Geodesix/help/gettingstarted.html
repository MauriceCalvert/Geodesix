            This tutorial will show you how to draw a simple map that plans a driving tour in Spain.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Open this workbook

                    The trip is the classic Costa del Sol, a traditional British pub crawl &#128521;.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To draw the cities on the map we need their coordinates : latitudes and longitudes.
                    Select cell B1. In the Geodesix ribbon, click the Insert Field icon.
                    In the left pane, double-click Latitude and then double-click Longitude.
                    In the right pane, double-click distance.
                    Close the Field Picker by pressing Escape or Enter.
                </li>
                <li>Select cell B2. Click the Insert Function icon. Click Geocode, the Get Geodesic Information window opens.</li>
                <li>
                    Leaving the cursor in the request field, click cell B1 and then click cell A2.
                    Click OK to close the prompt.
                <li>
                    Select cell B2 and observe the formula. Extend the formula to C2.
                    Extend the formulas B2:C2 down to B5:C5.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select cell D3, next to Valencia. In the ribbon, click Insert Function. Choose Travel
                    using the dropdown, set type to "Distance" and press Tab to move to the origin field.
                    Click cells A2 and then A3. Select mode "Driving" and click OK.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select cell D3 again and modify the formula by copy-pasting this:
                    <p><code>=Travel("Distance", A2, A3, "Driving")/1000</code></p>
                    to convert metres to kilometres. Extend the D3 formula down to D4 and D5.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select column D and set the format to Numeric, 0 decimals.
                    In the Geodesix ribbon, click View Map. <br />It is a 349 Km drive from Barcelona to Valencia.
                    With cell D3 selected, click View&#8658;Locate in the Geodesix ribbon.<br />
                    <p>Observe the drive path, in blue, along the coast, just north of Tarragona:</p>
