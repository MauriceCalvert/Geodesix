            <h1>Creating a new template to import structured files (JSON/XML)</h1>
            <p>
                Open the <a href="importfile.html">Import File</a> dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select a single file, which will be used as a sample to build the template.
                Select an existing template to modify or
                leave the <monospace>&lt;new&gt;</monospace> template and click Edit to start the template editor.
            </p>
            <img src="templateeditor.jpg" />
            <p>
                The sample file is displayed as a tree in the left panel.
                This example used <a href="takeout.json">takeout.json</a> and the template <monospace>TakeOutActivity</monospace>.
                The <monospace>Sample...</monospace> button
                allows different sample files to be loaded, to check against the template being edited.
                The tree is a subset that shows only a few examples of each unique node in the tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tree has <em>branches</em> (Root, timelineObjects, [0], placeVisit, location, ...) and <em>leaves</em>
                that have values (latitudeE7, longitudeE7, placeId, ...)
            </p>
            <p>
                The right panel is used to define how the data will be transformed into rows in the worksheet.
                Templates can be loaded and saved with the corresponding buttons.
                Each Path/Expression row of the template that has <monospace>Output</monospace> selected creates a column
                in the imported data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Double-clicking a <em>leaf</em> in the tree creates a Path on the right. The selected node and
                all nodes in the same position in the tree will be coloured blue.
                The parent node(s) of these blue nodes are coloured red.
                Each set of blue nodes under a red parent node will create one row in the output.
            </p>
            <h1>Template fields</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Action</b> Defines the function of this row. Actions are added by selecting from the Add dropdown at the top.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Expression</b> Defines a calculated field. The Source field contains the formula.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Import</b> Imports a namespace of custom functions that can be used in expressions.
                    Several namespaces are automatically imported:
                    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime">System.DateTime</a>,
                    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math">System.Math</a> and
                    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string?view=net-8.0">System.String</a>.
                    <a href="templateformulas.html">Details</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>Skip</b> The Source field is a boolean formula. If it evaluates to True, the current row being output is skipped.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Sort
                    </b> Defines the field on which the output will be sorted, A-Z.
                    When multiple files are being imported, the results are sorted all together.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>Name</b> Defines the name of the column.<br />
                <indent>
                    When parsing the data, the previous value of each expression is available
                    in a field with the same name, prefixed by an underscore.
                    For example, if there is a DateTime field called Timestamp, a field called _Timestamp
                    will exist with the previous value. This could be used to calculate an interval or distance
                    for use in a Skip condition.
                </indent>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Output</b> Determines if this row is included in the output or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Source</b> For Paths, the path in the tree. For expressions and skips, a
                <a href="templateformulas.html">formula</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Value</b> A sample value for paths, the result for skips and expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Type</b> The data type inferred from the value, which determine how the data is
                formatted when it is imported into Excel.
                <br />
                <indent>
                    <b>N.B.</b> The type is determined by the value
                    of the leaf that was clicked and it must be consistent. If the type is numeric (integer, double, ...)
                    and there are non-numeric values in the data, the import will fail.
                </indent>
            </p>
            <h1>Testing the template</h1>
            <p>The <monospace>Preview</monospace> button extracts the data and displays it in a new window:</p>
